# README

Traversing a binary tree of two-colored nodes. The root node is black and it has two children: A black node(left child) and a red node(right child.) All black nodes have children in the same manner (left-black/right-red), while all red nodes have children in reverse manner (left-red/right-black). Having a file uploaded which describes the Nth generation of nodes and the Jth sequence of the node in its generation, guess the color of it.
